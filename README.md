# Introduction

This is the companion repository for the paper (Vossen et al. 2023) we
submitted to the *2023 Integrated Communication, Navigation and
Surveillance Conference (ICNS)*.

Our work uses GraphWave (Donnat et al. 2018) to analyse the European
Aviation network and to highlight the structural impacts on it by the
COVID-19 pandemic.

You can find here

- a subset of the data, six weeks of flight list data in 2019, 2020,
  2021, and 2022
- the code to reproduce the model for the paper (and the provided data
  subset)
- the validation paper of the used model
