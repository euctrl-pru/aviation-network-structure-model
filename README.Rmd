# Introduction

This is the companion repository for the paper [@vossen2023] we submitted to
the *2023 Integrated Communication, Navigation and Surveillance Conference (ICNS)*.

Our work uses GraphWave [@donnat2018] to analyse the European Aviation network
and to highlight the structural impacts on it by the COVID-19 pandemic.

You can find here

* a subset of the data, six weeks of flight list data in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022
* the code to reproduce the model for the paper (and the provided data subset)
* the validation paper of the used model
